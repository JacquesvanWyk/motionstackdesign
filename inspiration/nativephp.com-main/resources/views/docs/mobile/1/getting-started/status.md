## Current Status

NativePHP for mobile is `beta` software. We believe it's already robust enough to build useful applications that can be
distributed to users, so we've made it available via an [Early Access Program](/ios).

The `beta` phase gives us the opportunity to work with the community to build more features and iron out issues.

If you're in the Early Access Program, please be sure to share your findings by
[raising issues](https://github.com/nativephp/ios/issues/new/choose)/reporting bugs, and on the `#early-access`
[Discord](https://discord.gg/X62tWNStZK) channel.
